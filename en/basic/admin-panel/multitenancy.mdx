## 2. Tiered Administrator System

Teable adopts a tiered administrator design, providing two different administrator roles: instance administrators have management privileges for the entire Teable instance, while organization administrators focus on managing specific organizations.

### Instance Administrator

**Scope of Authority**: Entire Teable instance
- Manage all organizations
- Configure system-level settings
- Set/remove organization administrator permissions

### Organization Administrator

**Scope of Authority**: Limited to specified organization
- Manage users and spaces within the organization
- View organization data statistics

### Administrator Permissions

| Role | Manage Organizations | Manage All Users | Manage Organization Users | Manage Spaces |
|------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| **Instance Administrator** | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All | ✅ All |
| **Organization Administrator** | ❌ None | ❌ None | ✅ This organization only | ✅ This organization only |
| **Regular Member** | ❌ None | ❌ None | ❌ None | ❌ None |

## 3. Use Cases

Organization functionality is suitable for various scenarios that require managing multiple independent teams within one system. Here are typical application cases:

### Enterprise Department Management

Suitable for data isolation and independent management between different departments within large enterprises. Each department can have its own organizational space with data that doesn't interfere with other departments, while being maintained by a unified enterprise IT team.
