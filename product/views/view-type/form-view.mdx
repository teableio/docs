Learn how to use Teable forms to collect information from anyone and automatically save it to the Teable database. Each form submission will create a new record in the table where the form view was created.

### Overview

Forms are ideal for logging expenses, collecting feedback, creating polls and quizzes, gathering customer information, and more. Teable forms support file attachments, perform well on mobile devices, and can connect to the Teable API. Unlike other products that require you to build forms from scratch, Teable's form view automatically generates from your existing table, allowing you to rearrange and remove fields.

You can customize your form by adding cover images and logos, customizing the form submission button, and removing Teable branding.

### **Step One: Add a New Form View**

To create a new form view, navigate to the table where you will collect new data. Open the view sidebar, then click the form option under the create header. If your view creation section is collapsed, you need to expand it first.

### **Step Two: Initial View Setup**

You'll have the opportunity to give your form view a unique title and set the view as collaborative or personal. Note that you can lock the form view only after completing the initial form view setup. After setting the title and view permissions, click to create a new view.

### **Step Three: Adding, Hiding, and Reordering Fields**

This opens the form builder, where you can further customize your form before sharing it with others. Advanced plans offer the ability to add cover images or logos to your form. You can add a description to your form by clicking the header area and adding a description.

Fields on the form are automatically filled based on all fields displayed in the first grid view that appears in the table.

To change the order of fields on the form, click a field and drag it using its handle. To hide a field from the form, click the hide button in the upper right corner of the field you wish to hide, or drag the field to the left side of the form builder. To add a field to the form, drag it from the left onto the form. If you realize you want to add a field to the form that does not yet exist in your table, you can click the + Add Field to This Table button in the field sidebar. Sometimes you may need to return to the form later to add or remove fields. Simply return to the form view and adjust the settings. You can also customize a field's settings by clicking on the field, clicking the dropdown arrow next to the field name, and selecting the Customize Field Type option from the dropdown menu. This opens the same field customization menu you see in the grid view.

### **Step Four: Customizing Form Fields**

In addition to customizing which fields appear on your form and their order, you can adjust how fields are displayed to the end user. Clicking any field in the form builder will pop up numerous display options. For all field types, you can change the field's name as displayed on the form and add a subtitle to provide useful context. Some field types offer additional display settings options, which will be introduced in the sections below.

You can also toggle the required option to make filling out a field a prerequisite for submitting the form. Note that if you make a checkbox field required, the checkbox must be checked to submit the form.

### **Step Five: Share Form URL**

After completing your form, click the share form button in the view bar. This will give you a link you can copy and paste. Clicking the preview button will also directly take you to the form share link in your browser. The sections below will cover more form sharing options.

### Additional Form Configuration Options

**Adding a Cover Image**

To add a cover image, click the add cover image in the gray area and upload your desired image. You can also crop or rotate the image in the file selector. Note that the area for the form cover image is always 240px high and the width of your browser window. It's best to use cover images as background graphics, adding an interesting touch to your form, rather than for important information that might be cropped.

**Adding a Password**

When sharing the form, you can choose to set a password, which must be entered correctly before the form can be submitted.

**Adding a Logo (Advanced Feature Only)**

To add a logo, click the add logo option and upload your desired image.

**Editing the Submit Label (Advanced Feature Only)**

To customize the form submission button/label, double-click the submit button, add your chosen text, then press enter/confirm.

**Viewing Submitters**

Enabling this feature will automatically collect the form submitter's user information, allowing you to track form responses to specific individuals. A few notes on expected behavior:

* Form submitters will be required to log in to Teable (if they have not already logged in on their browser) or create a Teable user account, so their name and email address can be collected with their form submission.

* The responder's information will appear in the "Creator" field in the table where the form was created.

**Showing or Hiding Teable Branding (Advanced Feature Only)**

To add or remove Teable branding, click the show Teable branding button at the bottom of the form builder.

### Customizing Form Fields

**Adding Conditional Logic to Form Fields**

Sometimes, you may want to limit which form fields appear based on certain conditions. Some examples include:

* Hiding certain fields unless another field option is selected.

* Showing fields to help submitters provide more in-depth information.

* Displaying fields related to specific teams or individuals based on previous form field entries. The conditional logic feature in the form view settings works the same as in other Teable interfaces.
