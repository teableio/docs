1. [Product](/product)

Fields in a table define the attributes of data and correspond to columns in a grid view.

Each field is named, such as "product\_name," serving as an identifier. Additionally, fields are assigned specific data types, like text, numbers, or boolean values, dictating the kind of data they can store.

#### Adding Fields

To add new fields within the grid view, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the grid view.

2. Scroll to the far right.

3. Click on the "+" sign at the very end of the field row.

<Accordion title="Considerations for Field Conversion">
  Editing a field can trigger a conversion to a new field type, like changing a single-line text field into a single-select field. However, some conversions may lead to data loss. For instance, converting a text field into an attachment field will erase all text data, as plain text cannot be transformed into attachments.

  If you notice any cell values missing after a conversion, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Z (or Command+Z for Mac) to undo the conversion and restore the field to its previous state, along with any data lost in the process.

  For detailed information on each field type and its customization options, please refer to the documentation for individual field types.
