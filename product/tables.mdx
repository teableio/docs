### Overview

Teable tables serve as a dynamic and robust platform for data management, akin to the functionality of tables in traditional spreadsheet software. These tables are designed to efficiently handle diverse datasets, offering a versatile display of information through various data types. Unlike ordinary spreadsheets, Teable enhances data interaction by allowing users to sort, filter, and aggregate data, alongside modifying numerous table characteristics. Teable uniquely supports multiple views such as grids, galleries, forms, calendars, and kanban boards, facilitating a comprehensive data management experience.

This guide aims to equip users with a thorough understanding of Teable tables, enabling effective organization and manipulation of data.

### Managing Data with Tables

Within Teable, bases act as central hubs, akin to file folders, for organizing multiple tables. This structure simplifies data analysis and interpretation, allowing for the storage of various tables under a single base to delineate projects or categorize information effectively. Tables in Teable are ideally suited for grouping data with common attributes, such as regional sales figures for different products, offering customization options through color-coded columns (fields) and rows.

Teable tables, mirroring the flexibility of spreadsheets, offer the convenience of editing or creating new tables within a base, each with its unique set of fields. Regardless of the chosen view—be it grid, gallery, form, calendar, or kanban—users gain a unique perspective on their work.

**Tip:** Maximize your data's potential by leveraging sorting and filtering options to customize your table views.

### Creating a Table

#### Getting Started

Teable facilitates easy data entry, whether starting from scratch or importing data from external sources. Users can quickly initiate a new table, adding columns and rows as necessary. To input data manually, at least one table must be present within the base for selection.

**Methods for Adding a New Table:**

* **Starting Fresh:** Launch a new table to gather and organize related data, viewable and manageable through various filters and sorting methods.

* **Table Duplication:** Easily copy an existing table, useful for modifying data without impacting the original dataset.

* **Importing Data:** Enhance your base by importing data through:

  * Pasting table data directly.

  * Importing CSV files.

  * Importing XLSX files.

#### Detailed Steps for New Table Creation

1. Within your base in the sidebar, select "+ Create table."

2. Assign a unique name to your new table to avoid confusion with existing tables.

3. Choose "Start with a new table" and click "Add table" to generate your new table, complete with default fields and rows.

#### Duplicating a Table

To duplicate a table in Teable, locate the desired table in the sidebar and click the vertical ellipsis (⋮) to access table options, then select "Duplicate." This action creates an identical table, positioned below the original, visible in the sidebar.

**Customizing a Duplicated Table**

After duplication, customize your table by:

* Modifying specific field values.

* Deleting irrelevant fields.

* Reordering fields to suit your data structure.
