### Overview

In the world of productivity and multitasking, efficiency is key. Recognizing this, Teable introduces a variety of views to cater to the dynamic needs of its users. With Teable, you can engage with your bases in multiple ways, enhancing both your understanding and interaction with data.

#### Understanding Views in Teable

Teable's view of management is intuitively split into two primary sections. The initial section showcases a list of your existing views within any selected table, offering quick access and overview. The subsequent section outlines the available core view types you can create within Teable, including Grid, and Form, (Gallery, Kanban, and Calendar views are coming soon), thus providing a versatile toolkit for data management.

It's important to note that all users, from Admins to Members, are empowered to modify views, ensuring a collaborative and flexible environment.

#### Default Grid View

Unlike traditional spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, which apply changes universally, Teable revolutionizes how data is presented. It allows for the creation of unique views for each table, catering to diverse needs and perspectives.

Upon creating a new table, the default view presented is the "Grid view." This view, reminiscent of conventional spreadsheet layouts with rows and columns, provides a familiar yet powerful interface for data interaction. It's designed to be immediately intuitive for those accustomed to spreadsheet software, offering a seamless transition to Teable's more flexible and feature-rich environment.

#### Model Data and View Customization

Each view in Teable is a representation of your data based on a specific model. This means any alterations made within a view can potentially impact all views, depending on your filter settings. This model-based approach ensures consistency across views while allowing for customized representations of your data.

Teable extends beyond traditional grid-based displays, offering various visualization options for your bases. Whether through forms, kanban boards, or galleries, you have the freedom to choose the most effective way to visualize and manage your data.

For instance, the form view offers a structured approach to input and display data, making it an essential tool for collecting information, managing submissions, and ensuring data consistency across various applications.

#### Data Management and Import Options

Teable empowers users to not only customize how data is viewed and managed but also provides robust options for data import. Users can import data from CSV, and XLSX files, or directly paste tabular data from other spreadsheet applications. This flexibility ensures that transitioning to or integrating with Teable is a smooth process, accommodating a wide range of data sources and formats.

In conclusion, Teable's innovative approach to data visualization and management through its versatile views offers a powerful, customizable experience. By harnessing these tools, users can tailor their workspaces to fit their unique needs, fostering a more efficient and collaborative environment.

### Configuration Options

Teable offers a versatile range of methods to manage records within a table, each with its unique interface. By defining views for each table in your base, you gain precise control over the display of fields, records, and additional settings within those views.

#### Overview

At the top of each view, Teable presents customization options, allowing for tailored field displays. Preferences set for field visibility are preserved per view, enabling distinct data display settings across your views without universal impact. Every adjustment to a view is recorded, facilitating straightforward revisitation.

Reordering views within a table is streamlined; simply drag a view to the top of the list to set it as the default. It's important to note that for shared tables within a team, this reordering will affect all team members.
