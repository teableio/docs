### Space Information

* **Space Name**: The display name of the space
* **Bases**: The total number of bases contained in the space
* **Collaborators**: The total number of users who have access to the space
* **Created Time**: When the space was created
* **Auto-join**: Whether the space allows new users to join automatically

### Space Operations

#### Auto-join

* **Allow Auto-join**: When enabled, all newly registered users will automatically join this space with [Read permission](/en/basic/space/space-invite). Useful for public or company-wide spaces.
* **Disallow Auto-join**: Disable automatic joining for new users.

#### Delete Space

<Warning>Spaces deleted from the admin panel **cannot be recovered**. Unlike regular space deletion, spaces deleted here do not enter the trash bin system.</Warning>

When you delete a space from the admin panel:
* The space is immediately marked as deleted
* All bases and data within the space become inaccessible
* Collaborators lose access to the space
* This operation cannot be undone

**Before deleting a space:**
1. Notify all collaborators about the deletion
2. Export or backup important data
3. Confirm that the space is no longer needed
4. Consider using the deactivate option if temporary removal is needed
