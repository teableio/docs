## Overview

Conditional Lookup is a cross-table data query feature that allows you to dynamically fetch qualifying data records from other tables based on configured filter conditions, without the need to pre-establish relationships between tables.

- **Flexible Filtering**: Support for complex condition combinations to precisely target relevant data
- **Dynamic Matching**: Reference current table field values as filter conditions for intelligent queries
- **Result Control**: Support for sorting and quantity limits to focus on key information

## Procedure

**Step 1: Create Conditional Lookup Field**
1. Click the + icon on the right side of the field name
2. Select "Conditional Lookup" field type
3. Enter field title (e.g., "Related Orders")

**Step 2: Select Target Table**
1. Choose the data table to query from the "Target Table Selection" dropdown menu
2. The system will display the field list of that table for subsequent configuration

**Step 3: Configure Lookup Field**
1. Select the data field to extract from the "Lookup Field"
2. Determine the return data type (text, number, date, etc.)

**Step 4: Set Filter Conditions**
1. Click "Add Filter Condition"
2. Select the field to filter
3. Select condition type (equals, not equals, contains, greater than, less than, contains, not contains, etc.)
4. Set comparison value:
   - Static value: Directly input specific numerical value
   - Field reference: Select current table field as dynamic value

**Step 5: Configure Sorting and Limits (Optional)**
1. Set sorting field and sorting method (ascending/descending)
2. Set display record quantity limit

**Note**: At least one filter condition must be configured. For multiple conditions, you can choose "All conditions met (AND)" or "Any condition met (OR)" logic.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Sales Data Period-over-Period Analysis

**Data Tables:**
- Period Sales Summary Table (contains period, start date, end date, sales amount fields)
- Sales Detail Table (contains sales amount, sales date fields)

**Scenario:**
Calculate period-over-period growth rates for each period in the period sales summary table. Obtain current and previous period sales amounts through conditional rollups, then use formulas to calculate period-over-period values for automated comparative analysis.

**Procedure:**

**Create Conditional Rollup Field for Current Period Sales**
1. Create new conditional rollup field in period sales summary table, title "Current Period Sales"
2. Target table: Sales Detail Table
3. Rollup field: Sales Amount
4. Filter conditions:
   - Field: Sales Date → Condition: Less than or equal → Value: End Date field of current table
   - Field: Sales Date → Condition: Greater than or equal → Value: Start Date field of current table
5. Aggregate function: Sum

**Create Conditional Lookup Field for Previous Period Sales**
1. Create new conditional lookup field, title "Previous Period Sales"
2. Target table: Period Sales Summary Table (this table)
3. Field: Current Period Sales
4. Filter conditions:
   - Field: End Date → Condition: Equals → Value: Previous Period End Date field of current table
5. Aggregate function: Sum

**Create Formula Field for Period-over-Period Calculation**
1. Create new formula field, title "Period-over-Period Growth Rate"
2. Formula: `(Current Period Sales - Previous Period Sales) / Previous Period Sales * 100`
3. Format: Percentage, 2 decimal places

### Use Case 2: Sales Data Product Analysis

**Data Tables:**
- Product Table (contains category ID, product name, sales volume fields)
- Category Table (contains category ID, category name fields)

**Scenario:**
Find the top-selling products in each category within the category table to quickly understand star products across different categories.

**Procedure:**

**Top Selling Product**
1. Create new conditional lookup field in category table, title "Top Selling Product"
2. Target table: Product Table
3. Lookup field: Product Name
4. Filter conditions:
   - Field: Category ID → Condition: Equals → Value: Category ID field of current table
5. Sorting: Sales Volume field → Descending
6. Limit display: 1 record

**Sales Volume**
1. Create another conditional lookup field, title "Sales Volume"
2. Target table: Product Table
3. Lookup field: Sales Volume
4. Filter conditions:
   - Field: Category ID → Condition: Equals → Value: Category ID field of current table
5. Sorting: Sales Volume field → Descending
6. Limit display: 1 record

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Why can't some fields be used as filter conditions?">
Filter field availability depends on the following limitations:
- **Field Type Limitations**: Certain complex field types (such as images, attachments) do not support filter conditions
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between Conditional Lookup and regular Lookup fields?">
Key differences:
- **Association Method**: Regular Lookup requires pre-established relationship fields, while Conditional Lookup can dynamically configure filter conditions
