## Creating Auto Number Fields

To set up an Auto Number field in your table, follow these steps:

* In the table view, click the "Add Field" button.

* Name the new field and select "Auto Number" as the field type from the dropdown menu.

Once created, this field will automatically assign a sequential number to each new record. These numbers are unique and won't be reordered even if records are deleted or other operations occur.

## Configuration and Customization

Auto Number fields currently have **no configurable options** in the field settings. The sequence is automatically generated by the system (typically starting from 1 and increasing by 1).

## Use Cases

### Order Tracking

Auto Number fields are ideal for tracking orders, especially when you need to assign a unique order number to each order.

### Member or Customer IDs

Assign unique IDs to your members or customers, ensuring everyone has a distinct identifier.

### Project Management

Automatically assign a project number to each new project, ensuring all projects can be easily tracked and referenced.

### Event or Ticketing Systems

Assign unique reference numbers to event participants or tickets.

## Important Notes

1. Auto Number fields are unique, sequential, and cannot be modified. Even after a record is deleted, its number will remain occupied and won't be reused.
