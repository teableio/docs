<Tip>Available for Enterprise Edition</Tip>

Teable supports Single Sign-On (SSO) integration to help you manage user authentication through your existing identity providers. Currently, we support:

* Standard OIDC (OpenID Connect)
* Feishu/Lark

## Understanding OIDC Configuration

When setting up OIDC integration, you'll need to configure the following parameters:

- **Name**: A descriptive name for your SSO configuration
- **Client ID**: A unique identifier assigned by your identity provider
- **Client Secret**: A secret key used to authenticate your application
- **Authorization URL**: The endpoint where users are redirected to authenticate
- **Token URL**: The endpoint used to exchange the authorization code for access tokens
- **User Info URL**: The endpoint to retrieve authenticated user information
- **Issuer**: The URL that identifies your identity provider

## Configuration Steps

1. Configure your identity provider:
   - Register your Teable application in your identity provider
   - Set the callback URL to: `https://app.teable.io/api/auth/authentication/__providerId__/callback`
   - Obtain the Client ID and Client Secret

2. Configure Teable:
   - Navigate to **Admin Panel** → **Authentication Settings**
   - Click "Create Authentication Provider"
   - Fill in the configuration details from your identity provider
   - After saving, you'll get a `providerId` - replace `__providerId__` in the callback URL with this value
   - Update this final callback URL in your identity provider's configuration

## Example: Configuring Authentik

Here's a practical example using Authentik as your identity provider:

1. In Authentik:
   - Create a new OAuth2/OpenID Provider
   - Initially set a temporary callback URL (you'll update this later)
   - Note down the Client ID and Client Secret

2. In Teable:
   - Create a new authentication provider with:
   ```
   Authorization URL: https://your-authentik-domain.com/application/o/authorize/
   Token URL: https://your-authentik-domain.com/application/o/token/
   User Info URL: https://your-authentik-domain.com/application/o/userinfo/
   Issuer: https://your-authentik-domain.com/application/o/teable/
   ```
   - After saving, note the generated `providerId`
   - Update your Authentik configuration with the complete callback URL: `https://app.teable.io/api/auth/authentication/YOUR_PROVIDER_ID/callback`

<Note>
Remember to replace `your-authentik-domain.com` with your actual Authentik instance domain, and `YOUR_PROVIDER_ID` with the ID generated by Teable. The exact URLs may vary depending on your identity provider's configuration.
