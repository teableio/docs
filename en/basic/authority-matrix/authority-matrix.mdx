title: "Authority Matrix"
---

Allows administrators to set fine-grained access permissions for team members. Through this approach, precise control over different tables, fields, and operations can be achieved, ensuring each member can only access and modify information within their scope of responsibility. This not only improves team collaboration efficiency but also enhances data security.

<Tip>Available for Pro plan and above</Tip>

## Example Use Cases

* Data Entry Restrictions: Allow team members to add new records but restrict modification of existing data
* Project Management: Ensure project members can only access and edit their responsible parts of the project
* Hierarchical Data Access: Flexibly organize roles so that enterprise management can view all data, while regular employees can only access information related to their responsibilities

## Operating the Authority Matrix

Users with Creator permissions in a space can enable the authority matrix. When the authority matrix is enabled, the current user automatically becomes an administrator, space managers also become administrators, and all other members are assigned to the default role by default.

### Creating Roles

Click the Add Role button in the upper right corner of the interface to start creating a new role

Enter the role settings interface to see all tables in the current base. Here you can set detailed permissions for each table

Permissions include view permissions, field permissions, and record permissions. By default, all permissions are open, and you can configure them by checking options to restrict permission scope according to requirements.

### View Permissions:

* Create views
* Delete views
* Update views

### Record (Row) Permissions

You can use filter condition groups to specify the range of viewable records. For example, adding a condition to select records where product type equals "Parts" will restrict the viewable record range for the current role to records of type "Parts".

* View records
* Delete records
* Update records
* Comment on records

### Field (Column) Permissions

You can restrict permissions for each field in the table, including:

* View fields related records
* Delete fields related records
* Update fields related records

After modifying table permissions, you must click the switch to the left of the table name to enable the permissions for them to take effect. If not enabled, there will be no permissions by default.

## Important Notes

Users with management permissions in the space have administrator privileges and can access all data in the base within the space.

After enabling the authority matrix, all newly created tables have no permissions by default and require permission configuration before they can be accessed according to role permissions.

The user who enables the authority matrix will become an administrator of the current base, and automation features will only be accessible to administrators after enabling the authority matrix.

After enabling the authority matrix, the creation, editing, and deletion permissions of fields (columns) themselves are only available to administrators.
