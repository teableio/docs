## One-Click Cloud Deployment

One-click templates help you bootstrap a Teable environment quickly. After deployment, if you want paid features (for self-hosted plans), you should **subscribe** and **activate your license** using your Instance ID.

## Step 1: Deploy with a template

Choose a template below and deploy.

## Step 2: Subscribe (paid features)

If you are deploying **self-hosted** and need paid features, subscribe with your **Instance ID**:

1. Open the Admin Panel in your deployed instance and copy the **Instance ID**
2. Go to the self-hosted pricing page and subscribe: `https://app.teable.ai/public/pricing?host=self-hosted`
3. After subscribing, you will get a **License Key**

Then activate it in your instance:

- Documentation: [Subscribe and Activate License](/en/deploy/activate)

<Note>
If you are using **Teable Cloud** (hosted by Teable), manage your plan in-app:
see [Billing & Subscription](/en/basic/space/billing).
