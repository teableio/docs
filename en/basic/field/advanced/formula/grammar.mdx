### Basic Elements

Our formula grammar consists of several basic elements:

* **Strings**: Text surrounded by single or double quotes, such as 'Hello' or "World".
* **Numbers**:
  * **Integers**: Pure numbers like 123 or -456.
  * **Decimals**: Numbers with decimal points like 12.34 or -45.67.
* **Boolean Values**: These include `TRUE` and `FALSE`, representing true and false states.
* **Field References**: Used to reference values from specific fields. They can be written as direct identifier names or surrounded by curly braces, such as `{age}`.

### Operators

Operators in formulas are used to connect or compare values:

* **Mathematical Operations**:
  * Addition (+)
  * Subtraction (-)
  * Multiplication (*)
  * Division (/)
  * Modulo (%)

* **Comparison Operations**:
  * Greater than (>)
  * Less than (\<)
  * Greater than or equal to (>=)
  * Less than or equal to (\<=)
  * Equal to (=)
  * Not equal to (!=)
* **Logical Operations**:
  * Logical AND (&&)
  * Logical OR (||)

### Function Calls

You can call functions within formulas. A function call consists of a function name, a pair of parentheses, and parameters inside the parentheses. Parameters are separated by commas.

For example: `sum(1, 2, 3)` calls a function named `sum` with three parameters: 1, 2, and 3.

### Other Structures

1. **Parentheses**: You can use parentheses to change operation precedence, such as `(1 + 2) * 3`.
2. **Comments**: To improve formula readability or provide additional context for other users, you can add comments. Block comments are enclosed by `/*` and `*/`, while line comments start with `//`.
3. **Whitespace**: In formulas, whitespace, line breaks, and comments are typically ignored, but they can help improve formula readability.
