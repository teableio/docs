Numeric field types allow for the input and storage of numerical data. These fields are versatile, catering to various business needs such as financial analysis and inventory management.

Numeric fields are strictly for numbers, including integers and decimals like "12" or "3.1415". Any non-numeric characters are automatically filtered out. You can also set numeric range constraints to ensure inputs fall within a specified interval.

These fields are invaluable for organizing data, enabling swift sorting and filtering to identify maximum or minimum values. Moreover, numeric fields can be incorporated into formulas for mathematical computations.

#### Formatting

Numeric fields offer three formatting options to suit various requirements:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Number">
    Displays as a standard number, e.g., 1, 2.0
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Currency">
    Displays with a currency symbol, e.g., $1.00
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Percentage">
    Displays in percentage format, e.g., 1%. Note: A 1% is stored as 0.01, and 100% as 1. Percentages can exceed 100%.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Formatting options enhance data presentation, making it more accessible and meaningful. This feature is not limited to numeric fields but can also be applied to formula fields, summary fields, and references for comprehensive data manipulation.
