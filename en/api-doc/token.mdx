Personal Access Tokens are best for scripts, internal tools, and server-side integrations.

If you're building a multi-tenant integration for external users, use OAuth instead: see [OAuth App](/en/api-doc/oauth).

## Create a token

1. Go to the [Token Management Page](https://app.teable.ai/setting/personal-access-token) and click the "Create Token" button to create a new personal access token.

2. Choose an expiration period for your token. Note that this period cannot be modified once set.

3. Add appropriate permission scopes to your token.

4. Specify which bases and spaces the token can access.

<Note>Once your token is created, it will only be displayed once. We recommend copying and storing it in a secure location.</Note>

## Use the token

Send the token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer __token__' \
  'https://app.teable.ai/api/table/__tableId__/record'
```
