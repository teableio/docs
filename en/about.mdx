## Why Teable?

No-code tools have significantly speed up how we get things done, allowing non-tech users to build amazing apps and changing the way many work and live. People like using spreadsheet-like UI to handle their data because it's easy, flexible, and great for team collaboration. They also prefer designing their app screens without being stuck with clunky templates.

Giving non-techy people the ability to create their software sounds exciting. But that's just the start:

* As businesses expand, their data needs intensify. No one wishes to hear that once their orders reach 100k, they'll outgrow their current interface. Yet, many no-code platforms falter at such scales.
* Most no-code platforms are cloud-based. This means your important data sits with the provider, and switching to another platform can be a headache.
* Sometimes, no-code tools can't do what you want because of their limitations, leaving users stuck.
* If a tool becomes essential, you'll eventually need some tech expertise. But developers often find these platforms tricky.
* Maintaining systems with complex setups can be hard for developers, especially if these aren't built using common software standards.
* Systems that don't use these standards might need revamping or replacing, costing more in the long run. It might even mean ditching the no-code route and going back to traditional coding.

#### What we think the future of no-code products look like

* An interface that anyone can use to build applications easily.
* Easy access to data, letting users grab, move, and reuse their information as they wish.
* Data privacy and choice, whether that's in the cloud, on-premise, or even just on your local.
* It needs to work for developers too, not just non-tech users.
* It should handle lots of data, so it can grow with your business.
* Flexibility to integrate with other software, combining strengths to get the job done.
* Last, native AI integration to takes usability to the next level.

In essence, Teable isn't just another no-code solution, it's a comprehensive answer to the evolving demands of modern software development, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their technical proficiency, has a platform tailored to their needs.
