Teable App Builder allows you to turn your data bases into fully functional, customized web applications without writing code. By combining the power of your data structure with AI-driven design, you can launch internal tools, customer portals, and data dashboards in minutes.

## Overview

The App Builder follows a "Prompt to App" workflow. You describe what you want, and AI builds the application structure, pages, and logic for you. You can then fine-tune every detail using the visual editor or code.

> **When to use App Builder vs AI Chat**: Use App Builder to create custom interfaces and standalone apps. For interactive data analysis and ad-hoc questions within the database, use [AI Chat](/en/basic/ai/ai-chat).

## Creating an App

There are two main ways to create an app:

1. **From Base**: In any Base, click "Create App" to generate an application linked to your current data.
2. **From Chat**: Open AI Chat and say "Create a CRM app for this customer table".

## The App Editor Interface

The App Builder provides a dual-interface for both non-technical users and developers.

### 1. Chat Interface (AI-Driven)
The command center for your app.
- **Natural Language Editing**: Describe changes like *"Make the header blue"* or *"Add a submission form for new records"*.
- **Auto-Routing**: The AI understands which component or page you are referring to and modifies it directly.

### 2. Live Preview Panel
- **Multi-Device Simulation**: Use the switcher at the top to toggle **Desktop**, **Tablet**, and **Mobile** views.
- **Instant Feedback**: Changes render immediately.

### 3. Developer Mode (Code Editor)
For infinite customization, you have direct access to the code.
- **Monaco Editor**: A VS Code-like experience right in the browser.
- **React Components**: Edit the underlying React code, Tailwind CSS classes, and logic.
- **File Tree**: Navigate through the project structure.

## Publishing & Management

### Publishing Your App
When your app is ready, click the **Publish** button (arrow icon) in the top right corner.
- **Public URL**: Teable generates a secure, publicly accessible URL for your app.
- **Custom Domain** (Coming Soon): Map your own domain to the app.

### Version History & Rollback
Teable automatically tracks every deployment.
- Click the **History** (clock icon) button to view a list of all deployed versions.
- **One-Click Rollback**: If a new update causes issues, you can instantly revert the live app to any previous stable version.

### Auto-fix
If your custom code changes cause a build error, the deployment will fail. 
- Teable provides an **Auto-fix** button alongside the error log.
- Clicking this lets AI analyze the compilation error and automatically patch the code to resolve the issue.

### Deleting an App
To delete an app, click the **Settings** (gear icon) button in the header and select **Delete**.

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Let AI build the basic structure first, then iterate on specific features.
- **Check Mobile**: Many users access apps on mobile devices, so frequently check the Mobile preview.
- **Version Control**: You can save versions or reset edits if you want to experiment with different designs.
