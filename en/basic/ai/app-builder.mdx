<Note>Available on all Cloud plans; Self-Hosted requires Business or higher.</Note>

Teable App Builder allows you to turn your data bases into fully functional, customized web applications without writing code. By combining the power of your data structure with AI-driven design, you can launch internal tools, customer portals, and data dashboards in minutes.

## Overview

The App Builder follows a "Prompt to App" workflow. You describe what you want, and AI builds the application structure, pages, and logic for you. You can then fine-tune every detail using the visual editor or code.

> **When to use App Builder vs AI Chat**: Use App Builder to create custom interfaces and standalone apps. For interactive data analysis and ad-hoc questions within the database, use [AI Chat](/en/basic/ai/ai-chat).

## Creating an App

There are two main ways to create an app:

1. **From Base**: In any Base, click "Create App" to generate an application linked to your current data.
2. **From Chat**: Open AI Chat and say "Create a CRM app for this customer table".

## The App Editor Interface

The App Builder provides a dual-interface for both non-technical users and developers.

### 1. Chat Interface (AI-Driven)
The command center for your app.
- **Natural Language Editing**: Describe changes like *"Make the header blue"* or *"Add a submission form for new records"*.
- **Auto-Routing**: The AI understands which component or page you are referring to and modifies it directly.

### 2. Live Preview Panel
- **Multi-Device Simulation**: Use the switcher at the top to toggle **Desktop**, **Tablet**, and **Mobile** views.
- **Instant Feedback**: Changes render immediately.

### 3. Developer Mode (Code Editor)
For infinite customization, you have direct access to the code.
- **Monaco Editor**: A VS Code-like experience right in the browser.
- **React Components**: Edit the underlying React code, Tailwind CSS classes, and logic.
- **File Tree**: Navigate through the project structure.

#### Download Code
You can download the entire app as a ZIP archive at any time:
1. Switch to the **Code** tab in the editor.
2. Click the **`...`** menu in the tab bar.

#### Import Code
You can update the app's code by importing a ZIP:
1. Switch to the **Code** tab in the editor.
2. Click the **`...`** menu in the tab bar.
3. Select **Import code** and choose a ZIP file (≤ 5 MB) containing your source files.

<Note>
Include source files only. Do not include `node_modules`, `.next`, or other build artifacts. Import merges with the existing project and overwrites any files that share the same path.
</Note>

## Publishing & Management

### Publishing Your App
When your app is ready, click the **Publish** button (arrow icon) in the top right corner.
- **Public URL**: Teable generates a secure, publicly accessible URL for your app.
- **Custom Domain** (Coming Soon): Map your own domain to the app.

### Version History & Rollback
Teable automatically tracks every deployment.
- Click the **History** (clock icon) button to view a list of all deployed versions.
- **One-Click Rollback**: If a new update causes issues, you can instantly revert the live app to any previous stable version.

### Auto-fix
If your custom code changes cause a build error, the deployment will fail. 
- Teable provides an **Auto-fix** button alongside the error log.
- Clicking this lets AI analyze the compilation error and automatically patch the code to resolve the issue.

### Deleting an App
To delete an app, click the **Settings** (gear icon) button in the header and select **Delete**.

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Let AI build the basic structure first, then iterate on specific features.
- **Check Mobile**: Many users access apps on mobile devices, so frequently check the Mobile preview.
- **Version Control**: You can save versions or reset edits if you want to experiment with different designs.

## Self-Hosted Configuration

If you're running Teable self-hosted, configure App Builder settings in **Admin panel → AI settings → App builder**.

### Required Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **v0 API Key** | Get from [v0.app/chat/settings/keys](https://v0.app/chat/settings/keys) |
| **Vercel API Token** | Get from [vercel.com/account/settings/tokens](https://vercel.com/account/settings/tokens) |


<Warning>
The v0 API requires a **paid v0 subscription**. Free tier credits are not sufficient. If you see "Internal Server Error" when creating apps, please upgrade your v0 plan.
</Warning>

### Custom Domain (Optional)

Apps built with App Builder are deployed to Vercel. There are two ways to use a custom domain:

#### Option A: Vercel Domains (Automatic)

Domains purchased from Vercel get automatic binding configured for you.

1. Purchase a domain from [Vercel Domains](https://vercel.com/domains)
2. Enter the domain in **Custom Domain** field in Admin Panel

#### Option B: External Domain (Manual DNS)

If you already own a domain from another registrar (e.g., Cloudflare, GoDaddy):

1. In Teable Admin Panel, enter your root domain in **Custom Domain** (e.g., `example.com`)
2. Add your **Vercel API Token**
3. When you publish an app, note the **App ID** from the URL (e.g., `appXXX123`)
4. In your DNS provider, add a CNAME record for each app:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Type | CNAME |
| Name | The app ID (e.g., `appXXX123`) |
| Target | `cname.vercel-dns.com` |
| Proxy | DNS only (if using Cloudflare) |

5. In Vercel Dashboard (Project → Settings → Domains), add the full domain (e.g., `appXXX123.example.com`) and click **Verify**
6. Once verified, HTTPS will be provisioned automatically

<Note>
Each app gets a unique subdomain based on its App ID. Path-based URLs (e.g., `yourdomain.com/app/xxx`) are not supported.
</Note>

### API Proxy (Optional)

For regions with restricted access to v0/Vercel APIs, you can configure proxy URLs:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **v0 Base URL** | Proxy URL for v0 API |
| **Vercel Base URL** | Proxy URL for Vercel API |

### AI Gateway (Optional)

If you use [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway), you can configure your API key here to enable:

- Centralized monitoring and logging of AI requests
- Rate limiting and cost controls
- Caching to reduce API costs

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **AI Gateway API Key** | Get from your Vercel AI Gateway settings |
