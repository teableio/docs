<Tip>
The Standalone Dashboard feature has been replaced by App Builder. **We strongly recommend using App Builder to build more powerful, customizable dashboards for the best experience.**

**However, if you are unable to connect to the v0 service** to build dashboards, you can follow the configuration steps below to enable the Standalone Dashboard as an alternative. Please note that we currently have no plans to further develop this feature, and we appreciate your understanding.

## Overview

For self-hosted Teable instances, the Standalone Dashboard feature is disabled by default. Follow the steps below to enable it.

## Steps

### Step 1: Execute SQL Statement

Connect to the PostgreSQL database used by Teable and execute the following SQL statement to set `disallowDashboard` to `false`:

```sql
UPDATE setting SET content = 'false' WHERE name = 'disallowDashboard';
```

### Step 2: Clear the Setting Table Cache

After executing the SQL, you need to clear the `setting` table cache for the configuration to take effect.

Since there is no direct cache-clearing entry point, you can trigger a cache refresh by **toggling any instance setting option**. For example:

1. Go to **Admin Panel** > **Instance Settings**
2. **Enable** the email verification option
3. **Disable** the email verification option again

<Callout type="info">
The purpose of this step is to trigger a cache refresh of the setting table. Simply toggling any setting option is sufficient — you don't need to permanently change any configuration.
</Callout>

After completing both steps, refresh the page and the Standalone Dashboard feature will be enabled.
