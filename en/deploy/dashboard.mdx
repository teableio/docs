## Overview

For self-hosted Teable instances, the Dashboard feature is disabled by default. Follow the steps below to enable it.

## Steps

### Step 1: Execute SQL Statement

Connect to the PostgreSQL database used by Teable and execute the following SQL statement to set `disallowDashboard` to `false`:

```sql
UPDATE setting SET content = 'false' WHERE name = 'disallowDashboard';
```

### Step 2: Clear the Setting Table Cache

After executing the SQL, you need to clear the `setting` table cache for the configuration to take effect.

Since there is no direct cache-clearing entry point, you can trigger a cache refresh by **toggling any instance setting option**. For example:

1. Go to **Admin Panel** > **Instance Settings**
2. **Enable** the email verification option
3. **Disable** the email verification option again

<Callout type="info">
The purpose of this step is to trigger a cache refresh of the setting table. Simply toggling any setting option is sufficient — you don't need to permanently change any configuration.
</Callout>

After completing both steps, refresh the page and the Dashboard feature will be enabled.
