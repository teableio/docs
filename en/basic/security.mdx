<Info>
Teable is committed to maintaining the security and privacy of your data. Our security practices are designed to protect your information while giving you full control over your workspace.
</Info>

## Data Encryption

### Encryption in Transit

All data transmitted between your browser and Teable servers is protected using **256-bit SSL/TLS encryption**. We enforce HTTPS for all connections with automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirection.

### Encryption at Rest

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Teable Cloud">
    All data stored in our databases is encrypted using **AES-256 encryption** through AWS infrastructure. This includes:
    - Database storage (PostgreSQL on AWS RDS)
    - File attachments
    - Backups
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Self-Hosted">
    You have full control over your encryption configuration based on your infrastructure requirements. We recommend:
    - Enabling database-level encryption
    - Using encrypted storage volumes
    - Implementing backup encryption
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Infrastructure Security

Teable Cloud is hosted on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** in the US-West (Oregon) region, leveraging AWS's enterprise-grade security infrastructure.

## Access Controls

### Role-Based Permissions

Teable provides granular role-based access control with five permission levels:

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control over the workspace, including billing and deletion |
| **Creator** | Can create tables, views, and manage workspace structure |
| **Editor** | Can edit records and field values |
| **Commenter** | Can view content and add comments |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to content |

### Authority Matrix

<Tip>
Authority Matrix allows fine-grained permission control at the field, record, and view level, enabling you to precisely define what each user or role can see and modify.
</Tip>

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Restricting sensitive fields (e.g., salary, personal information)
- Limiting record access based on ownership or department
- Creating custom views with different permission sets

### Share Link Protection

Protect your shared views with password authentication. When enabled, recipients must enter the correct password before accessing the shared content.

## Data Management

### Record History

Track all changes made to your records with a comprehensive revision history:
- See who made changes and when
- View previous values before modifications
- Understand the complete lifecycle of your data

### Trash & Recovery

Deleted items are moved to trash and can be recovered within the retention period, providing protection against accidental data loss.

### Data Backup & Export

Teable provides multiple options for backing up your data:

| Method | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **[Base Export](/en/basic/base/base#export-database)** | Download entire Base as `.tea` file (structure, data, automations) | Full backup, migration |
| **[Base Duplicate](/en/basic/base/base#duplicate-a-base-to-another-space)** | Create a copy of Base within Teable | Quick snapshot |
| **[CSV Export](/en/basic/table/export)** | Export individual table data | Data portability |
| **[API Export](/en/api-doc/record/get)** | Programmatically export records via REST API | Automated backups |

<Tip>
You can manually back up your bases by exporting the entire Base as a `.tea` file, exporting individual tables as CSV files, or retrieving your data via the Teable API.
</Tip>

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

Teable supports enterprise SSO through the **OIDC (OpenID Connect)** protocol, compatible with major identity providers:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use strong, unique passwords">
    Create passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Consider using a password manager.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enable SSO when available">
    Single Sign-On provides centralized authentication management and additional security controls.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review collaborator permissions regularly">
    Audit your workspace members and their permission levels periodically to ensure least-privilege access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use password-protected share links">
    When sharing views externally, always enable password protection for sensitive data.
