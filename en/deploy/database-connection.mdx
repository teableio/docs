To enable this feature, you need to configure the additional environment variable `PUBLIC_DATABASE_PROXY`

Configure this parameter with an externally accessible database IP or domain name + port number. If you're using the docker-compose deployment method mentioned earlier, the external access port is 45432. For other deployment methods, please configure according to your specific setup.

```
PUBLIC_DATABASE_PROXY=db-proxy.example.com:port
```
