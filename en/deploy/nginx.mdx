description: "Recommended Nginx reverse proxy setup for Teable: HTTPS (certificates), WebSocket, Docker tips, and Nginx Proxy Manager."
---

If you want to access Teable via a domain name, enable HTTPS (SSL termination), or keep Teable in a private network behind a single gateway, putting Nginx in front of Teable is a common setup.

<Callout type="info">
Key points:
- `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` must match the final public URL your users use (e.g. `https://teable.example.com`, without a trailing `/`)
- We strongly recommend treating **HTTPS + certificates** as the default (don’t run production traffic over plain HTTP)
- If you rely on WebSocket features, your reverse proxy must forward the `Upgrade/Connection` headers
</Callout>

## Recommended: HTTPS (default / production)

Treat HTTPS as the default: **serve end users on 443**; keep port 80 only for redirecting to 443 (or for ACME HTTP-01 challenges).

Below is a production‑style example (HTTPS + WebSocket + HTTP→HTTPS redirect). Replace the domain and certificate paths:

```nginx
upstream teable {
  server 127.0.0.1:3000;
  # If Nginx runs in the same Docker network as Teable:
  # server teable:3000;
}

map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
  default upgrade;
  '' close;
}

# Port 80 only redirects (or is used for ACME challenges)
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name teable.example.com;
  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;
  server_name teable.example.com;

  ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/teable.example.com/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/teable.example.com/privkey.pem;

  # If you’re sure the domain should always use HTTPS, you can enable HSTS (use with care)
  # add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://teable;

    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;

    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;

    proxy_http_version 1.1;
  }
}
```

### Certificates (issuance / renewal)

- **Let’s Encrypt (recommended)**: use Certbot or acme.sh for automatic issuance and renewal
- **GUI tools**: Nginx Proxy Manager can request and auto‑renew certificates from its UI

## Example 1: Minimal `location /` (quick start)

> Note: This is an **HTTP-only** example for internal networks or quick verification. For production, prefer the HTTPS configuration above.

```nginx
upstream teable {
  server 127.0.0.1:3000;
  # If Nginx runs in the same Docker network as Teable:
  # server teable:3000;
}

map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
  default upgrade;
  '' close;
}

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name teable.example.com;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://teable;

    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;

    proxy_http_version 1.1;
  }
}
```

## Docker tips

- **Nginx on the host, Teable in containers**: typically use `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;` (assuming `3000:3000` is published)
- **Nginx and Teable in the same Docker network**: you can route via the service/container name, e.g. `proxy_pass http://teable:3000;`

## Common pitfalls

- **Avoid path rewrites**: rewrites can break Teable’s internal routing unless you know exactly what you’re doing.
- **Make sure `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` is correct**: it affects generated URLs, redirects, import/upload flows, callbacks, etc.

## Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)

If you don’t want to write Nginx config by hand, GUI tools can help manage domains, certificates, and proxy hosts:

- **Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)**: common in Docker-based setups

For **Nginx Proxy Manager**, a typical setup is:

- **Create a Proxy Host**: set `Domain Names` to `teable.example.com`, `Scheme` to `http`, `Forward Hostname / IP` to `127.0.0.1` (or `teable` inside a Docker network), and `Forward Port` to `3000`
- **Enable WebSocket support**: turn on WebSocket support in Proxy Host options (label varies by version)
- **Provision/attach SSL**: request/select a Let's Encrypt certificate and optionally force HTTPS redirect
- **Don’t forget Teable env**: set `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to the final public URL (e.g. `https://teable.example.com`)
