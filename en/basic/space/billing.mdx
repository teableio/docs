## Billing Page Overview

The Billing page displays the following information:

### Current Plan

Shows your current subscription status including:

- **Subscription level** (Free, Pro, or Business)
- **Price per seat** (monthly or yearly)
- **Number of seats**
- **Renewal date** or cancellation date if applicable

Click the **Change plan** button to upgrade, downgrade, or modify your subscription.

### Usage Statistics

Monitor your space's resource consumption with these metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total collaborators** | Number of collaborators in the current space and its databases |
| **Total records** | Total row count across all tables in the space |
| **Attachments storage** | Total storage used by uploaded attachments |
| **Total emails** | Emails sent via automation using Teable Email Service |

<Tip>Data in both space trash and base trash are counted in the total record statistics. To reduce the total record count, clean up data in "Space → Trash" or "Base → Trash".</Tip>

### Credits

Credits are Teable's usage units for AI features and automations. They allow you to track and manage consumption of advanced capabilities in a transparent way. Credits reset every billing period and don't roll over.

**What uses credits:**
- **Automation actions** – 1 credit per automation action, plus additional credits for any AI actions, based on token usage.
- **AI features** – Including AI Field generation, AI Chat, and App Builder. Credit consumption is calculated based on the AI tokens used by the underlying language models.

**Monthly credit allocation per plan:**
- **Free**: 500 credits/month (fixed)
- **Pro**: 1,000 credits/seat/month
- **Business**: 2,000 credits/seat/month

When you add new billable collaborators, the seat count is updated at the start of the next billing cycle. Credits for new seats are allocated at that point on a prorated basis.

**Add-on credits:** Pro and above users can purchase additional credits.

**What happens when credits run out:** Once your monthly credits are exhausted, automation workflows will be paused, and AI features will be limited until the next billing cycle or until you purchase additional credits.

<Note>Credits only apply to Teable Cloud; self-hosted editions don't consume Teable Cloud credits and are instead limited by your own infrastructure and any external AI providers you use.</Note>

The credits section shows your total credits and current usage. Click **Detail** to view a breakdown of credit consumption by feature and month.

  <Accordion title="How does Teable's pricing work?">
    Seats are counted based on collaborators with **Editor** role or higher (Owner, Creator, Editor). Collaborators with **Commenter** or **Viewer** (Read-only) roles are free of charge.
    
    - **Cloud version**: Teable Cloud plans are billed per seat on a space basis. Seats are counted across the space. Charges are prorated: if you add billable collaborators partway through a billing period, you only pay for the remaining time in that period.
    - **Self-hosted version**: Pricing is based on a monthly or annual pre-paid seat license with no storage, row, or other usage limits. Seats are counted across the entire instance. If the number of users exceeds your license limit, you will need to upgrade your plan to add more seats. See [License Activation](/en/deploy/activate) for details.
