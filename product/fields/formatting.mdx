> The Rating field is displayed as an interactive score bar, represented by a series of icons that can be highlighted, not subject to number formatting but considered a numeric type for calculations.

> The formatting for Formula and Rollup fields depends on their output type, meaning if the result is a date or number, they can be formatted. If the result is text or a boolean value, formatting does not apply.

> All fields can be referenced, and once referenced, they still adhere to the basic value type of the field.

### Conclusion

Whether you are dealing with dates, times, or numbers, formatting features can make your data more user-friendly and clear. With simple settings, you can easily present your data as expected.
