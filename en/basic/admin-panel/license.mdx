2. After purchase, you will receive a license key
3. In the admin panel settings page, click the "Register License" button
4. In the popup dialog, enter your purchased license key
5. Click confirm to complete registration

### License Information

After successful registration, the license management area will display the following information:

* **License Type**: Shows the license version you purchased (e.g., Professional, Enterprise, etc.)
* **Number of Seats**: The maximum number of users supported by the license

### Handling License Expiration

When a license is about to expire or has expired:

* **30 days before expiration**: The system will display a reminder in the admin panel, suggesting timely renewal
* **7 days before expiration**: The reminder will be more prominent, please handle it as soon as possible
* **After expiration**: Enterprise features may be restricted, and users may not be able to use certain functions normally

<Warning>Please ensure renewal is completed before the license expires to avoid disrupting business operations.</Warning>

### Seat Management

The number of seats in a license determines the maximum number of users that can register:
