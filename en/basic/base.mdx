A base is a tool for storing and processing all information for a specific project. Each space can have multiple bases, and each base can work independently, providing a clear information structure for specific projects or table collections.

For users unfamiliar with bases, you can think of them as workbooks in Excel, where each workbook can contain multiple sheets.

### Adding a Base

2. Click "Create Base" in the upper right corner

### Renaming a Base

1. Enter a space
2. Hover over a base
3. Click the "···" button to open the menu
4. Click "Rename"

### Deleting a Base

1. Enter a space
2. Hover over a base
3. Click the "···" button to open the menu

### Duplicate a Base to Another Space

Step 1: In the workspace, select the base you want to move;

Step 2: Click the menu icon and select the Copy Base option;

Step 3: A popup window will appear with a dropdown menu of available spaces where you can duplicate the base to. You need Creator permissions in the target space to move the base there.

### Features Within a Base

A base can contain multiple tables for recording and organizing work or business-related information.

For example: A customer management base might have separate tables for "Customer Companies," "Customer Contacts," and "Customer Follow-up Records," while a meeting room management base might have separate tables for recording "Meeting Room Management," "Meeting Room Equipment," and "Meeting Room Reservations."

Therefore, most features within a base are related to tables:

* **Creating Tables**: Bases allow users to create new tables based on project-specific needs, where users can define table structure, fields, and data types.
* **Editing Tables**: Users can edit existing tables within the base, including adding, deleting, and modifying records.
* **Exporting and Importing Data**: Bases support exporting data to CSV, and importing data in both CSV and XLSX formats.

Refer to the [Tables section](/en/basic/table) for more information about tables.

### Advanced

Creating a base in Teable is equivalent to creating a Schema in PostgreSQL. Developers can leverage this feature to gain powerful SQL data access capabilities and enhanced database integration capabilities. For more details, please check the [SQL Query](/en/api-doc/sql-query) section.
