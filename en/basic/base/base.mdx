A base is a tool for storing and processing all information for a specific project. Each space can have multiple bases, and each base can work independently, providing a clear information structure for specific projects or table collections.

For users unfamiliar with bases, you can think of them as workbooks in Excel, where each workbook can contain multiple sheets.

### Adding a Base

1. Enter a space
2. Click "Create Base" in the upper right corner

### Renaming a Base

1. Enter a space
2. Hover over a base
3. Click the "···" button to open the menu
4. Click "Rename"

### Deleting a Base

1. Enter a space
2. Hover over a base
3. Click the "···" button to open the menu
4. Click "Delete"

### Duplicate a Base to Another Space

Step 1: In the workspace, select the base you want to move;

Step 2: Click the menu icon and select the Copy Base option;

Step 3: A popup window will appear with a dropdown menu of available spaces where you can duplicate the base to. You need Creator permissions in the target space to move the base there.

### Import Base (Data Migration)

The `.tea` file format allows you to import a complete base with all its tables, fields, data, and configurations. This is useful for:
- **Data Migration**: Move bases between different Teable instances (e.g., from Cloud to Self-Hosted)
- **Backup Restoration**: Restore a previously exported base
- **Template Sharing**: Share complete base structures with other teams

**Steps:**
1. Enter the workspace
2. Click the 「···」 button at the top right corner of the workspace to open the menu
3. Click 「Import」
4. Upload the `.tea` file to confirm the import

### Export Base (Backup & Migration)

Export your base to a `.tea` file for backup or migration purposes. The exported file contains all tables, fields, data, views, and configurations.

**Steps:**
1. Enter the workspace
2. Hover your mouse over the base you want to export
3. Click the 「···」 button to open the menu
4. Click 「Export」
5. The export result will be notified in the notification bar, where you can directly download the `.tea` file

<Tip>
**Data Migration Tip**: To migrate data between Teable instances, export your base from the source instance, then import the `.tea` file to the target instance. All data and configurations will be preserved.

### Features Within a Base

A base can contain multiple tables for recording and organizing work or business-related information.

For example: A customer management base might have separate tables for "Customer Companies," "Customer Contacts," and "Customer Follow-up Records," while a meeting room management base might have separate tables for recording "Meeting Room Management," "Meeting Room Equipment," and "Meeting Room Reservations."

Therefore, most features within a base are related to tables:

* **Creating Tables**: Bases allow users to create new tables based on project-specific needs, where users can define table structure, fields, and data types.
* **Editing Tables**: Users can edit existing tables within the base, including adding, deleting, and modifying records.
* **Exporting and Importing Data**: Bases support exporting data to CSV, and importing data in both CSV and XLSX formats.

Refer to the [Tables section](/en/basic/table) for more information about tables.

### Advanced

Creating a base in Teable is equivalent to creating a Schema in PostgreSQL. Developers can leverage this feature to gain powerful SQL data access capabilities and enhanced database integration capabilities. For more details, please check the [SQL Query](/en/api-doc/sql-query) section.
