### Introduction

The Auto Number field provides a method to automatically generate a unique sequence number when creating new records. This type of field is extremely useful when you need to assign a continuous, non-repeating identifier to each record.

### Creating an Auto Number Field

To set up an Auto Number field in a table, follow these steps:

* In the table view, click the "Add Field" button.

* Name the new field and select "Auto Number" as the field type from the dropdown menu.

Once created, this field will automatically assign a sequential number to each new record. These numbers are unique and will not be reordered due to record deletion or other actions.

### Configuration and Customization

#### Starting Value

When setting up an Auto Number field, you can choose a starting value. For example, if you want numbering to begin from "1001", you can specify this starting value in the field settings.

#### Format Options

Auto Number fields also support formatting options, allowing you to format the numbers in a specific way, such as numbers with prefixes or suffixes.

### Use Cases

#### Order Tracking

Auto Number fields are ideal for tracking orders, especially when you need to assign a unique order number to each one.

#### Membership or Customer Numbers

Assign unique IDs to your members or customers, ensuring each person has a distinct identifier.

#### Project Management

Automatically assign a project number to each new project, ensuring all projects can be easily tracked and referenced.

#### Events or Ticketing Systems

Assign a unique reference number to each participant or ticket for an event.

### Considerations

1. Auto Number fields are unique, sequential, and unmodifiable. Numbers will remain occupied even after records are deleted.

### Conclusion

Auto Number fields offer a simple, efficient way to assign unique sequence numbers to your records. Their continuity and uniqueness ensure the integrity and traceability of data, making them a valuable tool in various scenarios. Properly using Auto Number fields can greatly simplify your data management and tracking efforts.
