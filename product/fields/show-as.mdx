### Introduction

We've introduced a robust "show as" functionality that enables you to choose more interactive display methods for specific fields, thereby enhancing data readability and user interaction.

### Text Fields Show As

* **URL**: Converts text field content into clickable URLs, which open in a new tab when clicked.

* **Email**: Formats text field content as email addresses, opening the default email application for composing a message when clicked.

* **Phone**: Renders text field content as clickable phone numbers, initiating a call (depending on device capabilities) when clicked.

### Numeric Fields Show As

For numeric fields, the following display options are available:

**For Single-value Numeric Fields**:

* **Bar Chart**: Represents numeric values as bar charts. Options include customizing the color, deciding whether to display numeric values on the chart itself, and setting a specific number to represent the 100% maximum value for reference.

* **Ring Chart**: Shows numeric values in a ring chart format. You can customize the color, choose to display numeric values, and set a specific number as the 100% maximum value for reference.

**For Multi-value Numeric Fields**:

* **Bar Chart**: Displays multiple numeric values in a side-by-side bar chart format, with color customization available.

* **Line Chart**: Visualizes multiple numeric values as a line chart, with options for color customization.

These "show as" options allow for a more intuitive and engaging way to view and interact with your data, making it both more accessible and visually appealing.
