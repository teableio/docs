title: "Button"
---

The Button field is a powerful, interactive field that turns each row in your table into an actionable element. With a single click, users can instantly trigger a pre-configured automation, accomplishing everything from simple status updates to complex system integrations.

### **Feature Details**

*   **Trigger Automations with a Click**: A button serves as a manual trigger for your automations. This provides the perfect entry point for workflows that require a human decision to kick them off.

*   **Customizable Appearance**: Freely customize the button's label and color to make it visually intuitive and clearly communicate its purpose (e.g., "Submit for Approval," "Send Reminder," "Generate Report").

### **Use Cases**

The Button field is incredibly versatile, simplifying repetitive, multi-step manual tasks into a single click.

*   **Managing Statuses**: In a project management board, you can create buttons like "Start Task," "Mark as Complete," or "Archive." A single click can automatically update the "Status" field for that record, moving the workflow forward.

*   **Moving Data Between Tables**: In a CRM, when a lead is qualified, a "Convert to Opportunity" button can trigger an automation that copies key information from the lead record and creates a new entry in your "Opportunities" table.

*   **Sending Notifications**: Need to send a follow-up? A "Send Reminder" button can trigger an automation to send a customized message via email, Slack, or another service, complete with a link back to the specific record.

*   **Integrating with Other Systems**: By using an HTTP request as your automation's action, a button click can trigger actions in external services via their APIs.

### **How to Use**

1.  **Add and Configure the Field**: Create a new field in your table and select the "Button" type.
    *   **Label and Color**: Customize the text (e.g., "Send Email") and color of the button.
    *   **Limit Click** (Optional): Enable the "Limit number of clicks" toggle to set a maximum number of times the button can be clicked for each record (e.g., once). You can also configure whether the click count can be reset.
2.  **Custom Automation**: Create a new automation using "When a button is clicked" as the trigger.
3.  **Define the Action**: In the "Actions" section of your automation, define what you want to happen when the button is clicked, such as updating the record, creating a new record, sending an email, and more.

### **Important Notes**

*   **Automation Run Quotas**: Each successful button click that triggers an automation will count against your workspace's automation run quota. Please refer to our pricing and limits documentation for more details.
*   **Permissions are Separate**: The permission to click a button is separate from the permission to edit a record. **This means users with read-only access, or even visitors viewing a shared link, can click the button and trigger its automation as long as the button is visible to them.** This makes it a secure way to grant operational permissions for things like approvals, voting, or external feedback without granting access to edit the underlying data.
*   **Dependent on Automations**: A button does nothing on its own. Its functionality is entirely dependent on its linked automation. If the automation is disabled or deleted, clicking the button will have no effect.
