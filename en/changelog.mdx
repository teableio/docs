### The AI Database Agent
Teable AI Database Agent brings 6 big revolutions ‚Äî rewriting how we work with data:

2. Talk to Build Apps on Data: Generate apps directly from your database (e.g., turn a leads table into a landing page in minutes). Unlike vibe-coding tools that leave you with a dead app, Teable builds apps that actually run on live data
