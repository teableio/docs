## Overview

Conditional Rollup is a cross-table data query feature that performs statistical calculations on filtered data, returning a single aggregated result value. It allows you to obtain qualifying data from other tables based on configured filter conditions and perform statistical analysis without pre-establishing relationships between tables.

- **Conditional Aggregation**: Only perform statistics on data that meets conditions, excluding irrelevant data
- **Multi-dimensional Statistics**: Support for various calculation methods including sum, count, average, etc.
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically recalculate when source data changes to ensure data accuracy

## Procedure

**Step 1: Create Conditional Rollup Field**
1. Click the + icon on the right side of the field name
2. Select "Conditional Rollup" field type
3. Enter field title (e.g., "Total Sales Amount")

**Step 2: Select Target Table**
1. Choose the data table to query from the "Target Table Selection" dropdown menu
2. The system will display the field list of that table for subsequent configuration

**Step 3: Configure Rollup Field**
1. Select the data field to perform statistical calculations on from the "Rollup Field"
2. Determine data type (number, text, date, etc.)

**Step 4: Set Filter Conditions**
1. Click "Add Filter Condition"
2. Select the field to filter
3. Select condition type (equals, not equals, contains, greater than, less than, before, after, etc.)
4. Set comparison value:
   - Static value: Directly input specific numerical value
   - Field reference: Select current table field as dynamic value

**Step 5: Select Aggregate Function**

- Select appropriate calculation method based on data type: original value, unique, unique count, sum, count, average, maximum, minimum, etc.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Team Task Volume Statistics

**Tables:**
- Task Table
- Statistics Table

**Scenario:**
Team administrators need to count the number of tasks in different statuses for each employee, including in-progress and completed tasks, for workload management and progress tracking.

**Procedure:**

**In-Progress Tasks**
1. Create new conditional rollup field in employee information table, title "In-Progress Tasks"
2. Target table: Task Assignment Table
3. Rollup field: Task ID
4. Filter conditions:
   - Field: Assignee → Condition: Equals → Value: Employee field of current table
   - Field: Task Status → Condition: Equals → Value: "In Progress"
5. Aggregate function: Count All

**Completed Tasks**
1. Create another conditional rollup field, title "Completed Tasks"
2. Target table: Task Assignment Table
3. Rollup field: Task ID
4. Filter conditions:
   - Field: Assignee → Condition: Equals → Value: Employee field of current table
   - Field: Task Status → Condition: Equals → Value: "Completed"
5. Aggregate function: Count All

### Use Case 2: Find Duplicate Values

**Tables:**
- Customer Table (contains customer name, contact phone fields)

**Scenario:**
Find duplicate customer names in the customer table to identify duplicate customer records for data cleaning and customer information management.

**Procedure:**
1. Create new conditional rollup field in customer table, title "Customer Name Duplicate Count"
2. Target table: Customer Table (this table)
3. Rollup field: Customer Name
4. Filter conditions:
   - Field: Customer Name → Condition: Equals → Value: Customer Name field of current table
5. Aggregate function: Count All
6. Create new formula field, title "Duplicate Flag"
7. Formula: `IF(Customer Name Duplicate Count > 1, "❗️ Duplicate", BLANK())`

**Result**: The customer table will display the occurrence count of each customer name, and show "❗️ Duplicate" flag next to duplicate records for quick identification and processing of duplicate data.

## FAQ

<Accordion title="What's the difference between Conditional Rollup and Conditional Lookup?">
Key differences:
1. **Return Results**: Conditional Rollup returns a single calculated value, while Conditional Lookup returns a list of multiple original values
2. **Different Uses**: Conditional Rollup is used for statistical analysis, while Conditional Lookup is used for viewing detailed data
3. **Calculation Method**: Conditional Rollup includes aggregate calculations, while Conditional Lookup only filters and extracts data
