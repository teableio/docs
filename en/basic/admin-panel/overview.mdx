The Admin Panel provides centralized management for your Teable instance. As an administrator, you can manage Users, Spaces, Template Admin, Self-hosted License, Instance Settings, and AI Settings.

### Accessing the Admin Panel

After logging in as an administrator, click the "Admin Panel" button in the upper left corner of the application.

<Tip>Only instance administrators can access the admin panel. The first registered user automatically becomes an instance administrator.</Tip>
