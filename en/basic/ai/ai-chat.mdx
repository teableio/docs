Teable's AI Chat is a context-aware intelligent assistant that understands your data structure. Unlike generic AI, it knows your current table, view, and fields, allowing for precise data manipulation and analysis.

## Getting Started

You can start a conversation from anywhere in your Space by clicking the "Sparkles" icon in the top right corner.

### Suggested Prompts

When you open AI Chat, you'll see rotating prompt suggestions to inspire your first query:
- "Analyze the sales trend for this month"
- "Create a bar chart of revenue by category"
- "Build an inventory management app from this table"

Click any suggestion or type your own question to get started.

### Context Scope
AI Chat is context-aware. It automatically identifies:
- **Current Table**: Queries are scoped to the active table by default.
- **Current View**: If you have filters applied, AI respects them.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Deep Data Analysis (Text-to-SQL)
Teable's AI Chat doesn't just guess; it essentially functions as a professional Data Analyst.
- **SQL Generation**: It converts your natural language questions into complex, executable SQL queries.
- **Precision**: Because it executes code against your database, the results (counts, sums, averages) are 100% accurate, not hallucinations.
- **Complex Logic**: It can handle grouping, filtering, and cross-table references.
  - *"Which product category had the highest growth rate QoverQ?"*
  - *"List customers who haven't placed an order in the last 6 months but have a balance > 0."*

### 2. Intelligent Visualization
Turn data into insights instantly. AI Chat chooses the best chart type for your data.
- **Supported Charts**: Bar, Line, Pie, Scatter, Area, and more.
- **Interactive**: You can refine the chart by chatting. *"Switch to a stacked bar chart"* or *"Color code by region"*.
- **Dashboarding**: You can pin these generated charts to your dashboard (Coming Soon).

### 3. Builder Agent
AI Chat acts as a co-pilot for setting up your workspace.
- **Automations**: Describe a workflow, and AI will configure the triggers and actions.
  - *"When a new lead arrives, send a welcome email and create a task for the sales team."*
- **App Generation**: Transform tables into apps. For full customization, use the dedicated [App Builder](/en/basic/ai/app-builder).
- **Scripting**: For developers, it writes precise JavaScript code for specific column calculations or automation scripts.

### 4. Multi-modal Knowledge Base (RAG)
Combine your structured table data with unstructured files.
- **Document Analysis**: Upload PDFs, Excel files, or images.
- **Hybrid Search**: Ask questions that require reading the document AND checking the database.
  - *"Read this invoice (PDF) and match it with the record in the Orders table."*
  - *"Summarize the contract terms and check if this client violates them based on their usage record."*

### 5. Web Search
Get real-time information from the internet to enrich your analysis.
- **Live Data**: Query stock prices, news, or public datasets.
- **Context Fusion**: Combine web results with your table data for comprehensive answers.
  - *"Compare our Q3 revenue with the industry average published online."*

## Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Instead of "Analyze data", say "Analyze the sales trend compared to last year".
- **Reference Fields**: Use exact field names when possible (e.g., "Sort by 'Created Time'").
- **Iterate**: If the result isn't perfect, give follow-up instructions like "Change the chart color to blue" or "Filter out cancelled orders".
