#### Overview

Teable offers flexible collaboration permission settings to cater to the needs of various teams and projects. From full-control owners to read-only users with view-only access, Teable ensures every user can participate efficiently within their permission scope. By segmenting roles into owner/creator, editor, commenter, and read-only, Teable makes database management and collaboration both secure and convenient. Whether it's adding or modifying data, sharing view links, or adjusting space settings, every action is clearly permission-controlled to ensure data security and smooth project progression.

> To meet more granular permission needs, advanced permissions can be further designed in the future databases.
