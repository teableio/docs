> Scope indicates the actions individual access tokens can perform on resources.

[Individual access tokens](/developer/api/access-token) can only access API endpoints covered by the scopes granted to them. The complete reference information for available scopes is as follows.

In addition to requesting the correct scope, tokens must also possess the resources and permissions required to perform the actions.

**For example:** If an individual access token is granted the scope `record|read` and is associated with a base, it can access records within tables in that base, but it is not permitted to write records to tables in that base or access records from tables outside of that base.
