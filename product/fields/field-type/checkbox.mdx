### Introduction

Checkboxes offer a clear way to mark the status of a record, such as whether it's completed or selected. They provide a distinct binary state to data, simplifying the tracking and management of these states considerably.

### Creating a Checkbox Field

When you need to add a clear yes/no, completed/not completed, or any other binary state to your table, a checkbox field is the ideal choice. To add such a field, follow these steps:

* In your table view, click the "Add Field" button.

* Name your new field and select "Checkbox" as the field type from the dropdown menu.

### Use Cases

#### Task Tracking

Checkbox fields are perfectly suited for task management and project tracking, allowing you to easily mark tasks as completed.

#### Data Verification

During data auditing or proofreading, checkbox fields can help you indicate which data has been reviewed or verified.

#### Selections

If you're creating a survey or form and want users to select certain options, then checkbox fields are a great choice.

### Interaction with Other Fields

#### Counting with Formula Fields

You can use formula fields to count the number of checked records, which is particularly useful for tracking completed tasks or verified data.

#### Combining with Date Fields

When used alongside date fields, checkbox fields can indicate the completion status of a task or event, while the date field shows the specific date of completion.

### Summary

Checkbox fields are invaluable when you need clear and straightforward status tracking. Their intuitive design and ease of use make them a favorite in many projects and tasks. Using checkbox fields correctly can make your data management more efficient and organized.
