### Step 2: Visualize the Product - The AI Image Generator

<Note>
Before generating images (into an Attachment field), please configure a text-to-image model via Space Settings > Integrations > Add Custom AI Model.
</Note>

With the copy ready, what about visuals? Simply add another AI Field (set to the Attachment type) and have it reference our newly generated text to create stunning images:

1.  **`[AI] Product Concept Art`**:
    ```
    Based on the following description, generate a high-quality, minimalist rendering of the product in a modern office setting: {AI Extended Marketing Copy}
    ```

No designer needed. High-quality visuals that are perfectly matched to your copy are generated automatically.

### Step 3: Listen to Your Audience - The AI Feedback Analyzer

Once the product is launched, paste your collected user comments into another table. AI Fields will then perform an in-depth analysis automatically:

1.  **`[AI] Sentiment Analysis`**:
    ```
    Analyze the sentiment of {User Comment}. Respond with only 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral'.
    ```

2.  **`[AI] Keyword Extraction`**:
    ```
    Extract the top 3 keywords from {User Comment}.
    ```

3.  **`[AI] Issue Categorization`**:
    ```
    Classify the question {User Comment} into one of the following categories: feature suggestions, appearance design, battery life, price inquiry, etc.
    ```

### Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis with AI Chat

Forget manual filtering and pivot tables. It's time to talk directly to your data.

Open the table's **AI Conversation** feature. Think of it as your 24/7 data analyst.

-   **You ask the AI**: "What are the main themes in our negative feedback? List the top three."
-   **The AI answers**: "Based on the data, the most common negative feedback points are: 1. Noise cancellation (especially for voices); 2. Battery life; 3. The casing material is prone to fingerprints."

Using natural language, you can uncover core user insights in seconds, no complex formulas required.

### Step 5: Automated Data Visualization

Your conversation yielded a key insight. Now, it's time to share it with the team.

-   **You command the AI**: "Based on that last analysis, create a pie chart showing the count of user feedback by issue category."

Instantly, a clean, professional pie chart is generated for you.

From raw data to compelling charts, the entire journey from analysis to reporting is handled in a few simple prompts.

## Closing the Loop: From Insight to Action

With this suite of AI tools, you don't just know that users complained about "noise cancellation"; you've drilled down to discover the specific issue is with "high-frequency voices." You don't just know what features users love; you can instantly generate a chart to highlight them in your next team meeting.

This makes decision-making incredibly simple and precise:

1.  **For the Product Team**: They receive a report with a clear pie chart of user-reported issues. They immediately begin work on a next-gen algorithm to improve noise cancellation for human voices.
2.  **For the Marketing Team**: They get a bar chart showing the most popular selling points. They can now refine their ad campaigns to focus on "sleek design" and "temperature retention."
