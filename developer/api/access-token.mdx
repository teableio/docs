> Personal access tokens are equivalent to your user account and should be kept confidential and not shared with any third-party services or integrations.

Personal access tokens are tokens used for authentication and authorization. They are used to authenticate against Teable's API when developing integrations and extensions for yourself, clients, or your company.

### Creating a Token

1. Go to the [token management page](https://app.teable.io/setting/personal-access-token) and click the "Create Token" button to create a new personal access token.

2. Give your token a name and optionally add a description.

3. Choose an expiration for your token.

   Once your token is created, you won't be able to modify the expiration.

4. Choose the scopes of your token.

5. Add the bases or spaces your token can access. The token will only be able to read and write data in the bases and spaces assigned to it.

6. Once your token is created, we'll only display it to you once. We recommend copying and pasting it to a secure location for storage.
