### Overview

Forms are perfect for various purposes like recording expenses, collecting feedback, creating polls and quizzes, gathering customer information, and more. Teable forms support file attachments, work well on mobile devices, and connect to the Teable API. Unlike other products that require building forms from scratch, Teable's form views are automatically generated from your existing tables, then allow you to rearrange and remove fields.

#### Step 1: Add a New Form View

To create a new form view, navigate to the table where you'll collect new data. Open the view sidebar and click the form option under the create heading. If your view creation section is collapsed, you'll need to expand it first.

#### Step 2: Initial View Settings

You'll have the opportunity to give your form view a unique title and set the view as collaborative or personal. Note that you can lock the form view only after completing the initial form view settings. After setting the title and view permissions, click create new view.

#### Step 3: Add, Hide, and Reorder Fields

This opens the form builder where you can further customize your form before sharing it with others. Advanced plans offer the ability to add cover images or logos to forms. You can add a description to your form by clicking the header area and adding a description.

Fields on the form are automatically populated based on all fields shown in the first grid view of the table.

To change the order of fields on your form, click a field and use its drag handle to move it. To hide a field from the form, you can click the hide button in the top right corner of the field you wish to hide, or drag and drop the field to the left side of the form builder. To add a field to the form, drag it from the left side onto the form. If you realize you want to add a field to your form that doesn't yet exist in your table, you can click the + Add field to this table button in the fields sidebar. Sometimes you may need to return to the form later to add or remove fields. Simply return to the form's view and adjust the settings. You can also customize field settings by clicking the field, clicking the dropdown arrow next to the field name, and selecting customize field type from the dropdown menu. This opens the same field customization menu you see when customizing fields in grid view.

#### Step 4: Customize Form Fields

Beyond customizing which fields will appear on your form and their order, you can adjust how fields display to end users. Clicking any field in the form builder will pop up numerous display options. For all field types, you can change the name that displays on the form and add a subtitle to provide helpful context. Some field types offer additional display setting options, which are covered in the sections below.

You can also toggle the required option to make filling out a field necessary before submitting the form. Note that if you make a checkbox field required, the checkbox must be checked to submit the form.

#### Step 5: Share Form URL

Once you've finished building your form, you can click the share form button in the view bar. This will give you a link you can copy and paste. Clicking the preview button will also take you directly to the form share link in your browser. The sections below will cover more form sharing options.

### Additional Form Configuration Options

#### Adding a Cover Image

To add a cover image (requires an advanced plan), click add cover image in the gray area and upload your desired image. You can also crop or rotate the image in the file picker. Note that the form cover image area is always 240px tall and the width of your browser window. It's best to use cover images as background graphics that add an interesting feel to your form rather than for important information that might get cropped.

#### Adding Password Protection

When sharing a form, you can choose to set a password. In this case, the form can only be submitted after entering the correct password.

#### Track Form Submitters

Enabling this feature will automatically collect form submitter information so form responses can be traced to specific individuals. A few notes about expected behavior:

* Form submitters will be asked to log into Teable (if they aren't already logged in on their browser) or create a Teable user account so their name and email address can be collected with their form submission.

* The responder's information will appear in the "Created By" field in the table where the form was created.

### Conditional logic Form

#### Choosing the Right Approach

- **Form View (basics)**: Best for lightweight collection with basic field presentation and required fields (see Step 4 above for details).

- **App Builder (advanced, recommended)**: Best for a richer submission experience—conditional logic, multi-step flows, branded pages, and more complex interaction.
  - **Conditional Logic**: To show or hide follow-up fields based on conditions, build the submission experience in [Teable AI App Builder](/en/basic/ai/app-builder). Start from a short prompt, generate a first version, then refine the flow and UI.
  - **Prompt to App**: Describe what you want, generate a working first draft, then iterate.
  - **Start from your Base**: Click **Create App** to generate an app linked to your data.
  - **Start from AI Chat**: Open [AI Chat](/en/basic/ai/ai-chat) and ask AI to create an app for your table (for example: "Create an intake app for this table"). After the app is created, continue editing in App Builder.
  - **Publish & share**: When ready, publish your app to get a secure public URL.

> **When to use App Builder vs AI Chat**: Use App Builder to create custom interfaces and standalone apps. For interactive data analysis and ad-hoc questions within the database, use [AI Chat](/en/basic/ai/ai-chat).
