Conditional logic is a core component of Teable's automation features, allowing users to execute different actions based on specific conditions. This document explains how to use and combine conditional logic in Teable.

### Condition Types

Teable offers various condition types suitable for different data types and scenarios. Here are the commonly used condition types:

1. Text Field Conditions:
   * Is
   * Is not
   * Contains
   * Does not contain
   * Is empty
   * Is not empty
2. Number Field Conditions:
   * Greater than
   * Greater than or equal to
   * Less than
   * Less than or equal to
   * Equals
   * Does not equal
3. Selection Field Conditions (Single/Multiple):
   * Is any of
   * Is none of
   * Contains any of
   * Contains all of
   * Does not contain
4. Date Field Conditions:
   * Within
   * Before
   * After
   * On or before
   * On or after

### Special Date Operations

For date fields, Teable provides special operations to handle date-related conditions more conveniently:

1. Relative Dates:
   * Today
   * Tomorrow
   * Yesterday
   * One week ago
   * One week from now
   * One month ago
   * One month from now
   * X days ago
   * X days from now
2. Time Ranges:
   * Past week
   * Past month
   * Past year
   * Next week
   * Next month
   * Next year
   * Past N days
   * Next N days

### Combining and Grouping Conditions

Teable's conditional logic not only supports single conditions but also allows users to combine multiple conditions and create complex logical structures through grouping.

#### Combining Conditions

When working with multiple conditions, you can connect them using "AND" or "OR" operators:

* **AND**: All conditions must be met
* **OR**: Any one condition must be met

#### Condition Groups

For more complex logic, you can use grouping functionality. Groups allow you to combine multiple conditions together and treat the group as a single unit when performing "AND" or "OR" operations with other conditions or groups.

By flexibly using these conditional logic features, you can create precise and powerful automated workflows in Teable, greatly improving work efficiency and data management accuracy.
